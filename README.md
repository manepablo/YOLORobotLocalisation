The motivation of this project is the 3D bounding box estimation of a roboter using deep learning algorithms. Large groups of patients can benefit from the great potential of modern computer vision , for example in radiological diagnostics or in  automated surgery. Due to increasingly high-resolution images and increasing data volumes, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are particularly well suited to solve this problem due to their high performance. Therefore, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) network architecture as a state of the art real-time object detection system is introduced in this work. With small architectural modifications and a custom loss function, YOLO's high performance and accuracy in solving the problems of this work can be demonstrated. For this purpose, the object recognition was first implemented for a 2D problem and then extended to recognize the robot in a 3D to 2D projection. All in all it is determined that the 3D bounding box estimation can signiﬁcantly beneﬁt from
using YOLO as a fast and accurate bounding box regression system. Also the YOLO implementation is well suited for real-time image processing.
